### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 

  Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs since it was the first lab I had ever done getting me into the space of coding. Codeing was something I had never done before and getting into is fun and also hard at the same time since I am constantly learning how to do new things in order to make code work. While this was the easiest lab there was and very straight forward it was a great learning experince.

* Lab 3 

  Lab 3 part one was another one of my favorites since we were trying to code the steps into calulating the BMR of a person which wasn't too hard since we had a little help by the TODO's in the file. This was one of my favorites since I though about how it can be used in my personal life and how I could be able to code something the same as the bmr file. Doing this lab helped me realize how helpful coding is and how it can be implemented to other lives.

* Lab 8
  
  Lab 8 was another one of my favorite labs since it was also one of the hardest ones for me to understand espically trying to iterate, while doing this one and a coulple of other labs. I was able to get the hang of it. Though this lab was hard it was an experince to learn espically since I had a great partner who was able to explain it to me so while coding can be hard it showed me that there is no shame in asking for help or even to ask someone to explain whats going on.
